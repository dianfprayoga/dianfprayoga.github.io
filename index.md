## 🌟 Using SolidityDiagram

After launching the application, you can start visualizing Solidity smart contracts. Here’s how to make the most of its features.

### 🎯 Smart Code Analysis

- **Function Visualization**  
  Right-click any function in your Solidity code to generate a comprehensive diagram. This helps you see how functions relate to each other.

- **Data Structure Display**  
  The application automatically imports relevant structs, enums, and custom types used in the function, making it easy to understand the context.

- **Call Graph**  
  The call graph feature shows inner function calls along with their full implementations. This helps you track how data flows through your contract.

- **Interface Resolution**  
  It resolves interface calls to actual implementations across your workspace and its dependencies, helping you see the bigger picture.

- **Library Method Support**  
  The tool tracks `using LibraryName for Type` directives. This ensures you don’t miss important extension methods in your analysis.

- **State Variable Tracking**  
  It displays contract state variables referenced in functions, allowing for quick identification of how these variables influence your code.

### 🌊 Data Flow Analysis

- **Value Flow Tracking**  
  Visualize how values flow through functions. This feature allows you to understand how data is modified at each step.

## ⚙️ System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later, macOS Mojave or later
- **RAM**: Minimum 4 GB (8 GB recommended)
- **Disk Space**: At least 100 MB free space
- **Dependencies**:  
  Ensure that you have the latest version of Visual Studio Code installed, as SolidityDiagram is an extension for it.
